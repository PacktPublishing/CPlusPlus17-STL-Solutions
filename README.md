## About the Video Course
C++ has come a long way and is in use in every area of the industry. Fast, efficient, and flexible, it is used to solve many problems. The upcoming version of C++ will see programmers change the way they code. If you want to grasp the practical usefulness of the C++17 STL in order to write smarter, fully portable code, then this course is for you.

Beginning with new language features, this course will help you understand the language’s mechanics and library features, and offers insight into how they work. Unlike other courses, ours takes an implementation-specific, problem-solution approach that will help you quickly overcome hurdles. You will learn the core STL concepts, such as containers, algorithms, utility classes, lambda expressions, iterators, and more, while working on practical real-world videos. These videos will help you get the most from the STL and show you how to program in a better way.

By the end of the course, you will be up to date with the latest C++17 features and save time and effort while solving tasks elegantly using the STL.
